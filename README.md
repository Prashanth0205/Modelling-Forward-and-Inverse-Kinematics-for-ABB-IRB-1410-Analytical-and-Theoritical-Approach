# SOLVING FORWARD AND INVERSE KINEMATICS FOR ABB IRB 1410: THEORETICAL AND ANALYTICAL APPROACH

A general theory for modeling industrial robots is discussed and performing forward kinematics in a generic manner using DH parameters was done. Velocity kinematics was also done using a theoretical approach. Following this, Inverse kinematics was solved using one of the theoretical approaches for the spherical wrist industrial manipulator ABB IRB 1410. This was done by building an analytical model for the first three joints followed by the other revolute joints and a spherical wrist. Finally, an analytical approach for inverse Kinematics using computational techniques and concept of Jacobian was done and was found to be accurate. 

Keywords: Inverse Kinematics, Jacobian, Spherical Wrist.
