# Solving Forward and Inverse Kinematics for ABB-IRB-1410: Theoritical and Analytical Approach

A general theory for modeling industrial robots is discussed and performing forward kinematics in a generic manner using DH parameters was done. Velocity kinematics was also done using a theoretical approach. Following this, Inverse kinematics was solved using one of the theoretical approaches for the spherical wrist industrial manipulator ABB IRB 1410. This was done by building an analytical model for the first three joints followed by the other revolute joints and a spherical wrist. Finally, an analytical approach for inverse Kinematics using computational techniques and concept of Jacobian was done and was found to be accurate. 

Keywords: Inverse Kinematics, Jacobian, Spherical Wrist.

Code Descriptions:

1. IRB_1410_Decoupling_algo.m - This MATLAB code implements forward and inverse kinematics calculations for the ABB IRB 1410 manipulator using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. It computes the end-effector's position and orientation based on joint angles and vice versa, providing a theoretical framework for analyzing robotic motion.

2. IRB_1410_Jac_algo.m - This MATLAB code defines the DH parameters for the ABB IRB 1410 manipulator and computes the forward kinematics to obtain the end-effector transformation matrix. It then iteratively refines joint angle assumptions using the Jacobian and the difference between the theoretical and practical forward kinematics.

3. IRB_1410_VelocityKinematics.m - This MATLAB code calculates the forward kinematics for the ABB IRB 1410 manipulator using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. It then computes the end-effector position and velocity given a set of joint angles and angular velocities.
